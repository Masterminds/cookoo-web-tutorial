# The Cookoo Web Tutorial

This is a Git-based tutorial for building web applications using the
[Cookoo library](https://github.com/Masterminds/cookoo).

## Using Git Like A Book

Each chapter of this tutorial is on a separate Git branch. When viewing
the tutorial on GitHub, you can use the `branch` drop-down list to
select your chapter. Or you can clone this entire tutorial and navigate
along using your favorite Git client.

This file, `README.md`, will always be the main text of each chapter. As
we go, we'll also be adding code to the repository alongside the
`README.md`, so make sure you take a look around each branch.

## Here's Where it Gets Weird

To begin, select the
[Chapter 1](https://github.com/Masterminds/cookoo-web-tutorial/tree/1_Introduction)
branch.

```
$ git checkout 1_Introduction
```

And remember that at any time you can see the list of chapters by doing
a `git branch --list`.

[git checkout 1_Introduction](https://github.com/Masterminds/cookoo-web-tutorial/tree/1_Introduction)
